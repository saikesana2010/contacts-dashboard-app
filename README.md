# Contacts Dashboard App

A mobile app built with React Native (Expo) that:

âœ… Fetches contacts from https://randomuser.me/api  
âœ… Displays full name, email, profile picture  
âœ… Has a contact detail screen  
âœ… Allows toggling favorites  
âœ… Uses Zustand for state and persistence  
âœ… Bottom tab navigation between Contacts & Favorites

ðŸ“¦ Technologies:
- Expo (React Native)
- Zustand (State Management)
- AsyncStorage (Persistence)
- React Navigation
- TypeScript

ðŸš§ Note:
Due to time limits, the "Stats Screen" with bar chart and export-to-JSON were skipped.
